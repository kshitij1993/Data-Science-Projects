    "- We can say,from the dataset,that when a school is located at rural premises,there is a scarce possibility of such a school to have an experienced faculty due to lack or no resources to hire one.\n",

    "- However,there is a limitation of this approach that we cannot for sure analyse the lack of resources and experience for a particular school which send lesser participants for SAT examination.\n",
    "- One limitation of the proposed approach is that students intending to attend college are more likely to take the SAT and generally have stronger academic credentials than those not taking the exam. This effect is likely to be magnified in states where a low percentage of the student population take the exam, since SAT takers in those states are likely to be high achievers and are less representative of the total student population.\n",
    "- Also,SAT exam scores could not be the sole criteria for judging a school's prowess in terms of intelligence and quality of education.There could be various other factors which would be critical in determining a school's capability.\n",
